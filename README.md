# 42-So-Long

So_Long Project without any leaks in this project

## Check your Norm status
- norminette -R CheckDefine *.c
- norminette -R CheckDefine *.h

Because the mlx library that 42 provide to me have lots of Norminette error.
So if you want to avoid lots of Norminette error, than use the commands upper one.
